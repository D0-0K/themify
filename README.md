## Themify 2 Dev Builds

An ambitious and technically challenging remake of Themify, Themify 2 will be the ultimate version of the customisable UI for Rockbox iPods. Due to the difficult nature of the goals, development is expected to take quite some time. For this reason, development builds will available over time for users to test and provide feedback on the user experience, bugs and report crashes to help aid in the completion of this project. Thanks to anyone who seeks to help.

## Notes for Users

Minor flashes of UI elements are to be expected when using this theme. This is due to the logic needed to operate the Lockscreen feature. Please keep this in mind when using Themify.
